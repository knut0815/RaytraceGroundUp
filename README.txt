This repository contains an implementation of the raytracer outlined in "Ray Tracing from the Ground Up"
The project will be expanded as I work my way through the material. After completing the majority of RTfUG, I plan to
use this tracer as a base for adding techniques outlined in Physically Based Ray Tracing. This repository currently supports the following features:


Samplers
Implicit Spheres
Implicit Planes
Orthographic Camera

The next planned features are:
Materials
Scenes
Perspective Camera
